            Personne apatride / Stateless person

          description: >-
            <p>Imagine that you have a friend who comes from a country, but for some reason that country doesn't consider her to be one of its citizens, even though she was born there. Maybe it's because of complicated rules or political problems. And when she tries to go to another country, none of them will recognise her as one of their citizens either. She's stuck, as if she didn't belong to any country.  So when someone is stateless and arrives in France, they can ask for help to obtain a special status that allows them to stay here in safety, even if they are not a citizen of another country. It's a bit like a residence permit, but specifically for people who don't have a country.</p>

        - title: >-
            Personne réfugiée / Refugee

          description: >-
            <p>Refugee status is for people who need protection because they have fled danger in their home country. When these people arrive in France, if they ask the French government for help to stay here safely, they can apply for refugee status.</p>

        - title: >-
            Protection subsidiaire / Subsidiary protection

          description: >-
            <p>Subsidiary protection is a form of protection given by the state to people who cannot obtain refugee status, but who are nevertheless at risk in their own country. To obtain it, they must prove that they are likely to face one of the following situations:  - Being sentenced to death or executed ; - Being subjected to torture or cruel or degrading punishment; - Being seriously and personally threatened with death or violence as a result of armed conflict in their country.</p>

            Certificate of favorable decision / Attestation de décision favorable

          description: >-
            <p>The certificate of favorable decision (attestation de décision favorable) is an official document issued by the administrative authorities within the scope of an application for a residence permit. It certifies that the application has been accepted and that the applicant can now benefit from the residence permit applied for. This certificate confirms that all legal and administrative conditions have been successfully met, enabling the beneficiary to remain legally in the country for the period specified in the residence permit granted. It constitutes essential proof of the applicant's administrative situation, and facilitates subsequent procedures, such as requests for additional documents or access to certain rights and services.</p>

        - title: >-
            Instruction extension certificate / Attestation de prolongation d'instruction

          description: >-
            <p>An instruction extension certificate (attestation de prolongation d'instruction) is a document issued by the administrative authorities in connection with an application for a residence permit. It certifies that processing of the application is underway and will take longer than initially anticipated. This attestation enables the applicant to continue to reside legally in France while his or her application is being examined. It is generally issued when the time required to process an application exceeds the normal legal time limit. The instruction extension certificate thus provides proof of the administrative situation pending the final decision on the application for a residence permit.</p>

        - title: >-
            Confirmation of deposit / Confirmation de dépôt

          description: >-
            <p>The deposit confirmation is a document issued by the administration after an administrative procedure has been submitted, whether online or in person at a prefecture or any other competent authority. This confirmation certifies that the request has been received by the administration and recorded in its system. It may contain information such as the date and time of submission, as well as the reference number of the procedure. The deposit confirmation is important as it serves as evidence that the procedure has been initiated and often marks the starting point for the administration's processing of the request.</p>

            National Asylum Court (CNDA) / Cour nationale du droit d'asile (CNDA)

          description: >-
            <p>Imagine that someone comes to a country to ask for help because they are in danger in their home country. This person can apply for asylum to OFPRA, which we mentioned earlier. Now, if OFPRA says no to their application, they can appeal against this decision. This is where the CNDA comes in.  The CNDA is like a court specialized in asylum matters. It will re-examine the person's application and check whether OFPRA has made the right decision. To do this, it will listen to the person's story again, examine the evidence and decide whether they should be granted refugee status or another form of protection.</p>

        - title: >-
            Declaration on honor / Déclaration sur l'honneur

          description: >-
            <p>A declaration on honor is a written document by which a person affirms the truth of a piece of information or a fact without having to provide proof. It is often used for various administrative procedures, such as applying for social benefits, housing or competitive examinations. By signing a declaration on honor, the person undertakes to tell the truth, and acknowledges that any false declaration could lead to legal consequences. This document relies on the trust and integrity of the person signing it, and is a common practice for simplifying administrative procedures while preserving the authenticity of the information provided.</p>

            E-Photo

          description: >-
            <p> An e-photo, or electronic identity photo, is a digital image used for official documents such as identity cards, passports, or driver's licenses. It is typically taken in a specialized studio or by a photo booth and then uploaded to a computer or sent via email. The e-photo must meet specific criteria, such as size, neutral background, and the posture of the person photographed, in order to be accepted by authorities for official documents.</p>

            Schengen area / Espace Schengen

          description: >-
            <p>The Schengen area is like a special zone in Europe where several countries have decided to abolish border controls. This means that when you travel from one Schengen country to another, you don't need to show your passport or go through customs controls like at traditional borders. You can simply move freely from one country to another, as if it were one big borderless zone. It's convenient because it makes it easier to travel and trade between these countries.</p>

            French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) / Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides (OFPRA)

          description: >-
            <p>OFPRA, or the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons, is an organization in France that deals with people seeking asylum. But what exactly does that mean?  Imagine that someone leaves their country because of war, persecution or other dangers. This person goes to another country to find safety. When they arrive in France and think they are in danger in their country of origin, they can ask OFPRA for help.  OFPRA will then examine the person's situation to decide whether they are really in danger in their own country, or whether they need protection. To do this, OFPRA listens to their story, looks at the evidence they can provide, and assesses the risks they run in their country of origin.  If OFPRA considers that the person is indeed in danger, they can be granted refugee status. This means they can stay in France and benefit from special protection. If this is not the case, OFPRA may still decide to grant another form of protection, such as stateless status, which is a person who has no nationality.</p>

            Polygamy / Polygamie

          description: >-
            <p>Polygamy is a concept in which a person is married to several partners simultaneously. In France, polygamy is prohibited by law. This means that a person cannot be legally married to more than one partner at a time. This prohibition is designed to protect fundamental rights and values, such as gender equality and respect for human dignity. Polygamy is considered contrary to the principles of equality and free consent in marriage. It also poses legal, social and economic challenges in terms of children's rights and family protection.</p>

        - title: >-
            Prefecture and sub-prefecture / Préfecture et sous-préfecture

          description: >-
            <p>Prefectures and sub-prefectures are important administrative entities in the territorial organization of a country. A prefecture is the capital of a department, a larger administrative division. It is here that the representative of the State, the préfet, is located, responsible for ensuring that laws and government policies are applied at local level. Sub-prefectures, on the other hand, are administrative subdivisions of departments, often located in major towns outside the capital. They are headed by sub-prefects and help to coordinate government action at local level, facilitating administrative procedures for citizens and acting as a link between central government and local authorities.</p>

        - title: >-
            Receipt / Récépissé

          description: >-
            <p>A receipt (récépissé) is an official document issued by a competent authority to certify receipt of an application or file. It is often given to a person after they have submitted an administrative request, such as an application for a residence permit, driving license, etc. The receipt generally indicates the details of the application and the date on which it was submitted. It enables the holder to prove that he or she has taken the necessary steps while awaiting the outcome of the application. In general, the receipt offers a degree of legal protection while awaiting the issue of the final document requested.</p>

            Tax stamps / Timbre fiscal

          description: >-
