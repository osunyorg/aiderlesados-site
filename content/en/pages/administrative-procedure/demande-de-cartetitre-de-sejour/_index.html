    Application for a residence permit (refugees, stateless persons or beneficiaries of subsidiary protection)
  summary: >-
    <p>Do you or your family have refugee, stateless or subsidiary protection status? You can settle and work in France. To do this, you need to apply for your residence permit.</p>
  body: >-
      <p>All words followed by an * are defined just below the text or in the  simplified glossary .</p>  <p> What does it mean in practice?  <br>   <br>A residence permit is an official document authorising a refugee*, stateless person* or beneficiary of subsidiary protection* to reside in France for a specific period of time. The residence permit is issued by the prefecture or sub-prefecture of the person's place of residence. <br>The residence permit and the residence card are the same thing!</p>  <p>   <br>Personne apatride / Stateless person <br>Imagine that you have a friend who comes from a country, but for some reason that country doesn't consider her to be one of its citizens, even though she was born there. Maybe it's because of complicated rules or political problems. And when she tries to go to another country, none of them will recognise her as one of their citizens either. She's stuck, as if she didn't belong to any country.</p>  <p>So when someone is stateless and arrives in France, they can ask for help to obtain a special status that allows them to stay here in safety, even if they are not a citizen of another country. It's a bit like a residence permit, but specifically for people who don't have a country.</p>  <p>Personne réfugiée / Refugee <br>Refugee status is for people who need protection because they have fled danger in their home country. When these people arrive in France, if they ask the French government for help to stay here safely, they can apply for refugee status.</p>  <p>Protection subsidiaire / Subsidiary protection <br>Subsidiary protection is a form of protection given by the state to people who cannot obtain refugee status, but who are nevertheless at risk in their own country. To obtain it, they must prove that they are likely to face one of the following situations:</p>  <p>- Being sentenced to death or executed ; <br>- Being subjected to torture or cruel or degrading punishment; <br>- Being seriously and personally threatened with death or violence as a result of armed conflict in their country.</p>  <p> Are there different types of residence permit?  <br> Pour les protégés subsidiaires et les apatrides / For subsidiary protected persons and stateless persons  <br>These people are entitled to a  4-year  "multi-annual" residence permit. It cannot be given to people who hold one of the following permits:  <br> Residence permit "Temporary worker" (saisonnier)  ;  <br>  <br> Temporary residence permit for private and family life (Carte de séjour temporaire vie privée et familiale) issued to victims of human trafficking or procuring, or beneficiaries of a protection order;  <br>  <br> Temporary visitor's residence permit (Carte de séjour temporaire visiteur) ;  <br>  <br> Temporary residence card - Au pair (Carte de séjour temporaire jeune au pair) ;  <br>  <br> Temporary trainee residence permit (Carte de séjour temporaire stagiaire).  <br>  <br> Applications are made at the prefecture! To find your nearest prefecture, consult  the map from the Ministry of the Interior .</p>  <p> Pour les personnes avec le statut de réfugiés / For people with refugee status  <br>These people are entitled to a  10-year  "resident" card in France, if :  <br> you have been granted refugee status ;  <br>  <br> you are a member of the family of a refugee.  <br> </p>  <p> Rates </p>  <p>Source:  service-public.fr All payments must be made by  tax stamp .</p>  <p> Applying for a residence permit  <br> 1. Gather documents  <br>  <br> You will need :  <br>  <br> letter from OFPRA* or CNDA* with  declaration of status  (refugee, stateless person or beneficiary of subsidiary protection) ;  <br>  <br>  <br> proof of address  (domiciliation certificate/attestation de domiciliation or proof of accommodation/attestation d'hébergement)  less than 6 months old ;  <br>  <br> 3  e-photos* ;  <br>  <br> declaration of  non-polygamy  (if your parents come from a country that allows polygamy*).  <br>  <br> </p>  <p> 2. How to apply  <br>For stateless persons Go to  the nearest prefecture  to apply. Once you have submitted your application to the prefecture* or sub-prefecture*, you will be issued with a provisional residence document called a  receipt  ( récépissé)* . This allows you to work in France and to have "regular" status. For beneficiaries of subsidiary protection   and refugees Access the  Étrangers en France  (AENF) website:  <br> log in or create an account ;  <br>  <br> when logged in, click on "I'm applying for or renewing a residence permit" ;  <br>  <br> when the process is done you'll receive an e-mail confirming your application*;  <br>  <br> an "Attestation de prolongation d'instruction" letter will then be sent to your family, enabling them to work and ensuring "regular" status (it's temporary: it is valid for 6 months).  <br>  <br> Once your application has been validated by the prefecture, your family will receive the "Attestation de décision favorable*" letter, which is valid until you receive your residence permit. It allows you to work and travel within the Schengen area*.</p>  <p> 3. Get your residence permit  <br>Once the card is ready, the prefecture sends an SMS or e-mail. To collect it, you need to make an appointment on  the concerned prefecture's website . To obtain the residence permit, your family must provide proof of payment of  €25 in tax stamps*  (also available from tobacconists).</p>  <p> Renewal  <br> When?  <br>"When your residence permit approaches its expiration date (date marked as 'valid until'), you must apply for a new permit. This is called a "residence permit renewal'." Whether you're a refugee, a beneficiary of subsidiary protection or a stateless person, you need to apply online via the Étrangers en France (ANEF) website between 2 and 4 months before your card expires. Special cases After living in France for  4 years  with a card entitling you to  subsidiary protection , or if you are recognized as a  stateless person , you can apply directly for a  10-year resident card . However, in certain cases, prefectures may ask you for a letter explaining why you want this card, proof of your  level of French  or your  latest tax returns .</p>  <p> What documents should I provide?  <br>Civil status documents sent by OFPRA (birth certificate, marriage certificate if you are married);  <br> Letter with OFPRA or CNDA decision granting you refugee, subsidiary protection or stateless status; Proof of address less than 6 months old (or proof of address or proof of accommodation) ; 3 e-photos ; If you are married and come from a country where multiple marriages are allowed (polygamy), you must sign a declaration stating that you do not have several husbands or wives in France. This means that you cannot be married to several people at the same time here. The authorities may ask you for other documents. For example, in some prefectures, they may ask you for proof of your income or your work: such as your tax assessment, your employment contract or a certificate from Pôle Emploi... To renew your 10-year residence permit, some prefectures may ask you for a letter stating that you have not lived outside France for more than 3 years in a row.</p>  <p> Apply on the Étrangers en France (ANEF) website  <br>If you are a refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection, you must apply for a residence permit online at  administration-etrangers-en-france.interieur.gouv.fr . For stateless persons : If you are stateless, you can't apply online yet. If you have been recognized as stateless, you must go directly to your local prefecture to apply for a residence permit. The documents required are the same as those for the online application. <br>Important:  If you are unknown to the authorities, such as if you are a family member of a refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection or a stateless person, and you don't have a foreign number or visa, you must go directly to the prefecture to apply for your residence permit.</p>  <p> Simplified glossary  <br>   <br>Certificate of favorable decision / Attestation de décision favorable <br>The certificate of favorable decision (attestation de décision favorable) is an official document issued by the administrative authorities within the scope of an application for a residence permit. It certifies that the application has been accepted and that the applicant can now benefit from the residence permit applied for. This certificate confirms that all legal and administrative conditions have been successfully met, enabling the beneficiary to remain legally in the country for the period specified in the residence permit granted. It constitutes essential proof of the applicant's administrative situation, and facilitates subsequent procedures, such as requests for additional documents or access to certain rights and services.</p>  <p>Instruction extension certificate / Attestation de prolongation d'instruction <br>An instruction extension certificate (attestation de prolongation d'instruction) is a document issued by the administrative authorities in connection with an application for a residence permit. It certifies that processing of the application is underway and will take longer than initially anticipated. This attestation enables the applicant to continue to reside legally in France while his or her application is being examined. It is generally issued when the time required to process an application exceeds the normal legal time limit. The instruction extension certificate thus provides proof of the administrative situation pending the final decision on the application for a residence permit.</p>  <p>Confirmation of deposit / Confirmation de dépôt <br>The deposit confirmation is a document issued by the administration after an administrative procedure has been submitted, whether online or in person at a prefecture or any other competent authority. This confirmation certifies that the request has been received by the administration and recorded in its system. It may contain information such as the date and time of submission, as well as the reference number of the procedure. The deposit confirmation is important as it serves as evidence that the procedure has been initiated and often marks the starting point for the administration's processing of the request.</p>  <p> National Asylum Court (CNDA) / Cour nationale du droit d'asile (CNDA) <br>Imagine that someone comes to a country to ask for help because they are in danger in their home country. This person can apply for asylum to OFPRA, which we mentioned earlier. Now, if OFPRA says no to their application, they can appeal against this decision. This is where the CNDA comes in.</p>  <p>The CNDA is like a court specialized in asylum matters. It will re-examine the person's application and check whether OFPRA has made the right decision. To do this, it will listen to the person's story again, examine the evidence and decide whether they should be granted refugee status or another form of protection.</p>  <p>Declaration on honor / Déclaration sur l'honneur <br>A declaration on honor is a written document by which a person affirms the truth of a piece of information or a fact without having to provide proof. It is often used for various administrative procedures, such as applying for social benefits, housing or competitive examinations. By signing a declaration on honor, the person undertakes to tell the truth, and acknowledges that any false declaration could lead to legal consequences. This document relies on the trust and integrity of the person signing it, and is a common practice for simplifying administrative procedures while preserving the authenticity of the information provided.</p>  <p>E-Photo <br>An e-photo, or electronic identity photo, is a digital image used for official documents such as identity cards, passports, or driver's licenses. It is typically taken in a specialized studio or by a photo booth and then uploaded to a computer or sent via email. The e-photo must meet specific criteria, such as size, neutral background, and the posture of the person photographed, in order to be accepted by authorities for official documents.</p>  <p>Schengen area / Espace Schengen <br>The Schengen area is like a special zone in Europe where several countries have decided to abolish border controls. This means that when you travel from one Schengen country to another, you don't need to show your passport or go through customs controls like at traditional borders. You can simply move freely from one country to another, as if it were one big borderless zone. It's convenient because it makes it easier to travel and trade between these countries.</p>  <p>French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) / Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides (OFPRA) <br>OFPRA, or the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons, is an organization in France that deals with people seeking asylum. But what exactly does that mean?</p>  <p>Imagine that someone leaves their country because of war, persecution or other dangers. This person goes to another country to find safety. When they arrive in France and think they are in danger in their country of origin, they can ask OFPRA for help.</p>  <p>OFPRA will then examine the person's situation to decide whether they are really in danger in their own country, or whether they need protection. To do this, OFPRA listens to their story, looks at the evidence they can provide, and assesses the risks they run in their country of origin.</p>  <p>If OFPRA considers that the person is indeed in danger, they can be granted refugee status. This means they can stay in France and benefit from special protection. If this is not the case, OFPRA may still decide to grant another form of protection, such as stateless status, which is a person who has no nationality.</p>  <p>Polygamy / Polygamie <br>Polygamy is a concept in which a person is married to several partners simultaneously. In France, polygamy is prohibited by law. This means that a person cannot be legally married to more than one partner at a time. This prohibition is designed to protect fundamental rights and values, such as gender equality and respect for human dignity. Polygamy is considered contrary to the principles of equality and free consent in marriage. It also poses legal, social and economic challenges in terms of children's rights and family protection.</p>  <p>Prefecture and sub-prefecture / Préfecture et sous-préfecture <br>Prefectures and sub-prefectures are important administrative entities in the territorial organization of a country. A prefecture is the capital of a department, a larger administrative division. It is here that the representative of the State, the préfet, is located, responsible for ensuring that laws and government policies are applied at local level. Sub-prefectures, on the other hand, are administrative subdivisions of departments, often located in major towns outside the capital. They are headed by sub-prefects and help to coordinate government action at local level, facilitating administrative procedures for citizens and acting as a link between central government and local authorities.</p>  <p>Receipt / Récépissé <br>A receipt (récépissé) is an official document issued by a competent authority to certify receipt of an application or file. It is often given to a person after they have submitted an administrative request, such as an application for a residence permit, driving license, etc. The receipt generally indicates the details of the application and the date on which it was submitted. It enables the holder to prove that he or she has taken the necessary steps while awaiting the outcome of the application. In general, the receipt offers a degree of legal protection while awaiting the issue of the final document requested.</p>  <p>Tax stamps / Timbre fiscal <br>The tax stamp is a specific form of tax used for different types of administrative transactions, such as visa applications, passports, residence permits, etc. It takes the form of a physical or electronic document that proves that the tax associated with the application has been paid. It takes the form of a physical or electronic document proving that the tax associated with the application has been paid. The amount varies according to the type of application and the laws in force. Tax stamps are often required to finance public services or regulate certain activities, and their use guarantees that administrative procedures are carried out in accordance with current regulations.</p>  <p> Ressources  <br> Foreigners : where to get information?  <br>Center de contact citoyen - DGEF - Foreigners in France</p>  <p>https://administration-etrangers-en-france.interieur.gouv.fr/particuliers/#/contact</p>  <p> Online help  <br>Find contact details for authorized photographers and photo booths</p>

            Certificate of favorable decision / Attestation de décision favorable
          description: >-
            <p>The certificate of favorable decision (attestation de décision favorable) is an official document issued by the administrative authorities within the scope of an application for a residence permit. It certifies that the application has been accepted and that the applicant can now benefit from the residence permit applied for. This certificate confirms that all legal and administrative conditions have been successfully met, enabling the beneficiary to remain legally in the country for the period specified in the residence permit granted. It constitutes essential proof of the applicant's administrative situation, and facilitates subsequent procedures, such as requests for additional documents or access to certain rights and services.</p>

            Instruction extension certificate / Attestation de prolongation d'instruction
          description: >-
            <p>An instruction extension certificate (attestation de prolongation d'instruction) is a document issued by the administrative authorities in connection with an application for a residence permit. It certifies that processing of the application is underway and will take longer than initially anticipated. This attestation enables the applicant to continue to reside legally in France while his or her application is being examined. It is generally issued when the time required to process an application exceeds the normal legal time limit. The instruction extension certificate thus provides proof of the administrative situation pending the final decision on the application for a residence permit.</p>

            Confirmation of deposit / Confirmation de dépôt
          description: >-
            <p>The deposit confirmation is a document issued by the administration after an administrative procedure has been submitted, whether online or in person at a prefecture or any other competent authority. This confirmation certifies that the request has been received by the administration and recorded in its system. It may contain information such as the date and time of submission, as well as the reference number of the procedure. The deposit confirmation is important as it serves as evidence that the procedure has been initiated and often marks the starting point for the administration's processing of the request.</p>

            National Asylum Court (CNDA) / Cour nationale du droit d'asile (CNDA)
          description: >-
            <p>Imagine that someone comes to a country to ask for help because they are in danger in their home country. This person can apply for asylum to OFPRA, which we mentioned earlier. Now, if OFPRA says no to their application, they can appeal against this decision. This is where the CNDA comes in.  The CNDA is like a court specialized in asylum matters. It will re-examine the person's application and check whether OFPRA has made the right decision. To do this, it will listen to the person's story again, examine the evidence and decide whether they should be granted refugee status or another form of protection.</p>

            Declaration on honor / Déclaration sur l'honneur
          description: >-
            <p>A declaration on honor is a written document by which a person affirms the truth of a piece of information or a fact without having to provide proof. It is often used for various administrative procedures, such as applying for social benefits, housing or competitive examinations. By signing a declaration on honor, the person undertakes to tell the truth, and acknowledges that any false declaration could lead to legal consequences. This document relies on the trust and integrity of the person signing it, and is a common practice for simplifying administrative procedures while preserving the authenticity of the information provided.</p>

            E-Photo
          description: >-
            <p> An e-photo, or electronic identity photo, is a digital image used for official documents such as identity cards, passports, or driver's licenses. It is typically taken in a specialized studio or by a photo booth and then uploaded to a computer or sent via email. The e-photo must meet specific criteria, such as size, neutral background, and the posture of the person photographed, in order to be accepted by authorities for official documents.</p>

            Schengen area / Espace Schengen
          description: >-
            <p>The Schengen area is like a special zone in Europe where several countries have decided to abolish border controls. This means that when you travel from one Schengen country to another, you don't need to show your passport or go through customs controls like at traditional borders. You can simply move freely from one country to another, as if it were one big borderless zone. It's convenient because it makes it easier to travel and trade between these countries.</p>

            French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) / Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides (OFPRA)
          description: >-
            <p>OFPRA, or the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons, is an organization in France that deals with people seeking asylum. But what exactly does that mean?  Imagine that someone leaves their country because of war, persecution or other dangers. This person goes to another country to find safety. When they arrive in France and think they are in danger in their country of origin, they can ask OFPRA for help.  OFPRA will then examine the person's situation to decide whether they are really in danger in their own country, or whether they need protection. To do this, OFPRA listens to their story, looks at the evidence they can provide, and assesses the risks they run in their country of origin.  If OFPRA considers that the person is indeed in danger, they can be granted refugee status. This means they can stay in France and benefit from special protection. If this is not the case, OFPRA may still decide to grant another form of protection, such as stateless status, which is a person who has no nationality.</p>

            Polygamy / Polygamie
          description: >-
            <p>Polygamy is a concept in which a person is married to several partners simultaneously. In France, polygamy is prohibited by law. This means that a person cannot be legally married to more than one partner at a time. This prohibition is designed to protect fundamental rights and values, such as gender equality and respect for human dignity. Polygamy is considered contrary to the principles of equality and free consent in marriage. It also poses legal, social and economic challenges in terms of children's rights and family protection.</p>

            Prefecture and sub-prefecture / Préfecture et sous-préfecture
          description: >-
            <p>Prefectures and sub-prefectures are important administrative entities in the territorial organization of a country. A prefecture is the capital of a department, a larger administrative division. It is here that the representative of the State, the préfet, is located, responsible for ensuring that laws and government policies are applied at local level. Sub-prefectures, on the other hand, are administrative subdivisions of departments, often located in major towns outside the capital. They are headed by sub-prefects and help to coordinate government action at local level, facilitating administrative procedures for citizens and acting as a link between central government and local authorities.</p>

            Receipt / Récépissé
          description: >-
            <p>A receipt (récépissé) is an official document issued by a competent authority to certify receipt of an application or file. It is often given to a person after they have submitted an administrative request, such as an application for a residence permit, driving license, etc. The receipt generally indicates the details of the application and the date on which it was submitted. It enables the holder to prove that he or she has taken the necessary steps while awaiting the outcome of the application. In general, the receipt offers a degree of legal protection while awaiting the issue of the final document requested.</p>

            Tax stamps / Timbre fiscal
          description: >-
            <p>The tax stamp is a specific form of tax used for different types of administrative transactions, such as visa applications, passports, residence permits, etc. It takes the form of a physical or electronic document that proves that the tax associated with the application has been paid. It takes the form of a physical or electronic document proving that the tax associated with the application has been paid. The amount varies according to the type of application and the laws in force. Tax stamps are often required to finance public services or regulate certain activities, and their use guarantees that administrative procedures are carried out in accordance with current regulations.</p>
